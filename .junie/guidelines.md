# Junie Guidelines for Next.js + TypeScript Project

## Guidelines

- Implement or refactor the project's structure to align with professional best practices for Next.js version 15+ and Typescript version 5+.
- Many of my Markdown files are severely outdated, so they cannot be trusted.

## Additional Tools

- `pnpm biome-check` is a command line tool for errors, problems, and maintaining conventions.
