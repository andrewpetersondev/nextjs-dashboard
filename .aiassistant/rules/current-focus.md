# Current Focus

I want to perfect my signup code. i want to handle everything from dal to repo to service to action to form validation
to ui. if there are any bad practices, poor organization, etc i want to fix it. To do this i will need to strengthen my
logic for results, errors, and forms.

Focus on code related to:

- signup
    - src/features/auth
    - src/server/auth
- result helpers
    - src/shared/core/result
- error flows
    - src/shared/core/errors
    - src/server/errors/
- forms
    - src/shared/forms
    - src/server/forms

Secondary focus on:

- result & form & error cohesion
- organization
- reusable code
- removing duplication

Ignore:

- src/features/customers/
- src/server/customers/
- src/features/invoices/
- src/server/invoices/
- src/features/revenues/
- src/server/revenues/
- src/features/users/
- src/server/users/
