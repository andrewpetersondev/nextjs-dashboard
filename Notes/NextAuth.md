# Next.js Authentication

## Question: Explain export async function signup(formData: FormData) {}

The code snippet you've shared is actually a Server Action in Next.js, written in TypeScript, and it's not a complete
TSX component by itself. Let me break down the key characteristics:

TypeScript Syntax
The async function signup(formData: FormData) uses TypeScript syntax with a type annotation for formData
FormData is a TypeScript type that represents form submission data
The : FormData type annotation is a TypeScript-specific feature

Server Action Characteristics 4
The function is designed to be a Server Action in Next.js
Server Actions are asynchronous functions executed on the server
They can be used to handle form submissions and data mutations

Here's a more complete example to illustrate how this might be used:

```ts
'use server'

export async function signup(formData: FormData) {
	// Validate form data
	const name = formData.get('name')
	const email = formData.get('email')
	const password = formData.get('password')

	// Perform server-side logic like user creation
	try {
		// Example: Create user in database
		// const user = await createUser({ name, email, password })

		return {
			success: true, message: 'User signed up successfully'
		}
	} catch(error) {
		return {
			success: false, message: 'Signup failed'
		}
	}
}
```

Key points about this Server Action 4 :

It uses the 'use server' directive at the top of the file
It's an async function that can be called from both Server and Client Components
It receives FormData as a parameter, which allows easy access to form fields
It can perform server-side operations like validation and database interactions
It returns a serializable result that can be used by the client
When used in a form, it might look like this:

```tsx
'use client'

import {useActionState} from 'react'
import {signup} from './auth-server-actions'

export default function SignupForm() {
	const [state, formAction] = useActionState(signup, {
		success: false, message: ''
	})

	return (<form action={formAction}>
			<input type="text" name="name" required/>
			<input type="email" name="email" required/>
			<input type="password" name="password" required/>
			<button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
			{state.message && <p>{state.message}</p>}
		</form>)
}
```

This approach leverages Nextjs' Server Actions to create a secure, type-safe way of handling form submissions directly
on the server 4 .
