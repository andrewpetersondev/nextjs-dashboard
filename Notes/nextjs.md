# solving source map for debugging

## Question : 

i am trying to use a debug configuration but my breakpoints are not getting recognized. i should note that i am using webstorm, docker compose, and docker containers

## Response:
Here are several steps to help you diagnose and resolve breakpoint recognition issues:

Verify Docker Configuration yaml version: '3.8' services: your-service: build: . volumes: - ./:/app # Ensure source code is mounted - /app/node_modules # Preserve node_modules environment: - NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect # Enable Node.js debugging ports: - "9229:9229" # Expose debug port

WebStorm Remote Debugging Configuration Here's how to set up a remote debugging configuration:

Go to Run → Edit Configurations
Click the '+' button and select 'Remote'
Configure these settings:
Name: Docker Node.js Debug
Host: localhost
Port: 9229
Local root: [Your project root directory]
Remote root: /app (or wherever your code is in the container)

Dockerfile Modifications ```dockerfile FROM node:18

Enable source maps and debugging
ENV NODE_OPTIONS="--enable-source-maps"

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install

COPY . .

Use node with inspect flag
CMD ["node", "--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229", "your-main-file.js"] ```

Troubleshooting Checklist
Ensure source maps are generated
Verify volume mounts match exactly
Check that breakpoints are set in the correct file version
Confirm source code paths are identical in local and container environments

WebStorm Specific Tips
Use 'Attach to Node.js/Chrome' debug configuration
Verify 'Use source map' is checked in debugger settings
Rebuild your Docker containers after configuration changes

## Question : Do i need to enable source maps in next.config.ts?

## Response:
To help you resolve the breakpoint recognition issue, I'll provide some steps and configurations to troubleshoot:

Next.js Source Map Configuration ```tsx / @type {import('next').NextConfig} */ const nextConfig = { productionBrowserSourceMaps: true, // Enable source maps in production webpack: (config, { isServer }) => { config.devtool = 'source-map'; // Ensure source maps are generated return config; } }
module.exports = nextConfig ```

Docker Compose Configuration yaml version: '3.8' services: nextjs: build: . ports: - "3000:3000" # Add debugging port - "9229:9229" environment: # Enable Node.js inspector for debugging - NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 volumes: # Mount source code to enable live debugging - ./:/app - /app/node_modules - /app/.next

WebStorm Remote Debugging Configuration In WebStorm:
Go to Run → Edit Configurations
Click '+' and select 'Node.js Remote Debug'
Set Host to 'localhost'
Set Port to '9229'
Name the configuration (e.g., 'Docker Debug')
Additional Troubleshooting Tips: - Ensure your package.json has a dev script that supports source maps:

json
{
"scripts": {
"dev": "next dev --sourcemap"
}
}

Verify your Dockerfile includes source map support: dockerfile # Install dependencies that support source maps RUN npm install --save-dev @next/source-map-support
Key Considerations: - Source maps must be explicitly enabled - Docker needs to expose the debugging port - WebStorm must be configured for remote debugging - Volumes must be set up to map source code correctly
