# Drizzle Infer (Select vs Insert)


In DrizzleORM, InferInsertModel and InferSelectModel are type helpers used to infer types for database operations, replacing the deprecated InferModel starting from version 0.28.3.

InferSelectModel generates a type that represents the structure of data retrieved from a database query, including all fields that are returned, such as id and createdAt, which are typically auto-generated by the database.

Conversely, InferInsertModel creates a type for data that is inserted into the database, excluding auto-generated fields like id and createdAt, ensuring that these fields are not required during insertion.

These types can be accessed via table.
- $inferSelect and table.
- $inferInsert, or directly using the InferSelectModel and InferInsertModel helpers with the table definition.

This distinction allows for more precise type safety in applications, ensuring that insert operations do not require fields that are managed by the database.
