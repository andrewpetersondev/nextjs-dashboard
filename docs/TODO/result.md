Checklist:

- Keep Result simple and layer-agnostic
- Decouple UI needs from domain errors via adapters
- Decide dense vs sparse for FormState explicitly
- Make E flexible with presets and mappers
- Outline migration steps and guardrails

Recommendation:

- Keep Result<T, E> as-is and layer-agnostic. Let E vary by layer:
  - Domain: unions like ValidationError | NotFoundError
  - Infra: RepoError, DatabaseError
  - UI adapters: DenseFormErrors<Field>
  - Public APIs: DTOs { code: string; message: string } or a discriminated union
- Do not force dense error maps in Result globally. Instead, adapt at boundaries.

FormState choice:

- If your UI consistently benefits from dense errors (deterministic shape, simpler rendering), change FormStateFailure["errors"] to DenseFormErrors<TFieldNames>.
- If you prefer smaller payloads and simpler “only render what’s wrong,” keep sparse. Both are fine; be consistent.

How to reconcile flexibility and UI needs:

- Use an adapter per boundary:
  - Result<T, E> -> FormState: require E = DenseFormErrors<Field> in that adapter’s signature. Other Result usages stay unaffected.
  - Result<T, AppError> -> API response: mapErr to a serializable DTO shape.
- Provide presets/utilities:
  - ResultPublic<T, E = { code: string; message: string }> for public/API layers.
  - ErrValidation(errors) to ergonomically produce Result<never, DenseFormErrors<Field>> for forms.
  - fromPromise/fromDal with mapError to normalize thrown/unknown errors to your Error-like E.

Guardrails and conventions:

- At module boundaries, pick a concrete, serializable E; avoid unknown.
- Internally, it’s fine for E to be Error; map to public DTOs before returning outward.
- Prefer Ok/Err constructors to keep discriminants literal.
- Centralize field-error building (dense or sparse) in one place to avoid drift.

Migration options:

- If you switch FormState to dense:
  - Update FormStateFailure to use DenseFormErrors<Field>.
  - Remove sparse conversion in your adapter; pass E through as-is.
- If you keep FormState sparse:
  - Keep current adapter that converts Dense -> Sparse; continue returning Dense in Result for form flows only.

Net: Keep Result simple and flexible; specialize at boundaries with adapters and small helpers. This lets you use Result widely without coupling it to any single error shape.
