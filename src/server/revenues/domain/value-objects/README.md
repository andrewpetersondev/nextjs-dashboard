# Revenues Domain / Value Objects

Purpose:
- Define immutable, identity-less domain constructs (e.g., Money, Period, Currency).
- Enforce invariants and validation at creation.

Notes:
- Prefer readonly properties and factory methods.
- No barrel files. Do not move existing code yet; migrate later.
