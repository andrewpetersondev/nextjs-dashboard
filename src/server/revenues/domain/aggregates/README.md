# Revenues Domain / Aggregates

Purpose:
- Define aggregate roots for the Revenues bounded context (e.g., RevenueAggregate).
- Encapsulate invariants and transactional consistency boundaries.

Notes:
- Do not add barrel files.
- Do not move existing code here yet. You can migrate aggregate roots and factories later.
