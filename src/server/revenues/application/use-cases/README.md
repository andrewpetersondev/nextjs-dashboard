# Revenues Application / Use Cases

Purpose:
- Application services orchestrating domain behavior for the Revenues context.
- Implement commands/queries coordinating repositories and domain services.

Guidelines:
- Keep use-case functions small and focused.
- No framework dependencies; pure application logic.
- Do not add barrel files. Do not move existing code yet; migrate later.
