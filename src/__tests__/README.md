# \_\_tests\_\_

This folder will contain unit and integration tests for the application.

- Use Jest or Vitest for test implementation.
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` suffix.
- Mock external dependencies and database access.
- Do not place Cypress tests here; use the `cypress/` directory or colocate Cypress component tests with components.

Refer to the root `README.md` for testing guidelines.
