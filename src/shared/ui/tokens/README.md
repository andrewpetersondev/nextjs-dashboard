# ui/tokens

Design tokens for UI elements, such as images and timings. Organize reusable design constants for consistency.

## Overview

- Centralize design constants (colors, spacing, images, timings).
- Promote consistency and easy updates across UI components.
- All tokens are strictly typed and documented.

## Usage Example

```ts
import {IMAGE_TOKEN} from './images';

<img src = {IMAGE_TOKEN.hero}
/>
```
