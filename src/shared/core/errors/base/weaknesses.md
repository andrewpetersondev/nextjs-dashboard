Here are focused weaknesses in `src/shared/core/errors/base/base-error.ts`:

1. Instance freezing breaks stack preservation and subclassing

- `Object.freeze(this)` in the constructor makes later `next.stack = this.stack` assignments in `withContext`/`remap` and `wrap` no-ops. The try/catch hides this failure.
- Freezing in `super`’s constructor prevents subclasses from adding own fields after `super(...)`, effectively blocking ergonomic subclass extensions.

2. Incorrect typing of ErrorOptions.cause

- `super(message, { cause: sanitizedCause as Error | undefined })` narrows `cause` to `Error`, but the JS spec (and TS lib) allow `unknown`. This violates the project rule “prefer satisfies over as” and may pass a non-Error object under an unsafe cast.

3. Cross‑realm brittleness in guards

- Reliance on `instanceof BaseError` (`isBaseError`, external guards) can fail across multiple realms/bundles; consider a duck‑type brand or well‑known symbol.

4. Context sanitization only in dev

- In prod, non‑serializable values can still enter `context` (no sanitization), causing downstream `JSON.stringify(error.toJSON())` failures if `context` holds e.g. BigInt or cyclic structures.

5. `safeStringifyUnknown` may leak function source

- For functions, `JSON.stringify` yields `undefined`, then `String(value)` returns the function’s source code, which can leak internals. Should redact to a stable token like `[Function]`.

6. Side‑effectful deep freeze

- `deepFreezeDev` enumerates properties and reads values directly, triggering getters with side effects or throws. It does not use descriptors to avoid accessors.

7. Duplicate cause storage and potential leakage

- Both `this.cause` (sanitized via `super`) and `this.originalCause` (raw) retain references, increasing memory use and risk of sensitive data exposure (e.g., via custom serializers or `util.inspect`). `originalCause` is enumerable unless explicitly defined otherwise.

8. Stack handling is inconsistent

- Attempting to copy `stack` onto a frozen `next` instance is unreliable and silently skipped. If preserving the original stack is critical, capture and set it before freezing or use `Error.captureStackTrace`.

9. Overly wide `category` typing

- `category` is typed as `string`; it could derive a literal union from metadata to tighten type safety.

10. File size and cohesiveness

- The module is large and multi‑purpose (>200 LOC). Per project rules, consider splitting helpers (`safeStringifyUnknown`, redaction, freeze/sanitize) into small, named modules to improve maintainability.

11. Console noise in dev

- Direct `console.warn` inside sanitization couples core logic to the console and can be noisy; prefer a centralized logger adapter.

12. Commented dead code

- The commented `sanitizedCause` code path adds noise; remove or document rationale inline.
