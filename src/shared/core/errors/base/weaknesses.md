Here are focused weaknesses and potential gaps to consider:

1. Immutability scope

- Context is frozen, but the error instance itself isnâ€™t deeply frozen in dev; properties could still be reassigned accidentally (e.g., message).
- Cause can contain mutable objects; no guard against leaking mutable state via context.

2. Subclass ergonomics

- withContext/remap return BaseError, not the subclass type; this breaks fluent APIs for domain-specific errors.
- No protected factory/hooks for subclasses to customize metadata or enrich context consistently.

3. Options vs positional args

- Constructor uses positional parameters; easy to swap message/context
