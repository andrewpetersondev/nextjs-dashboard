# Branding Core

Branding constants and logic for application identity, such as brand names, colors, and assets. Keep branding concerns
isolated for maintainability.

## Purpose

- Centralize branding assets and constants for consistency.
- Enable easy updates to brand identity across the application.

## Usage

- Add brand colors, logos, and naming constants here.
- Avoid mixing branding logic with business or infrastructure concerns.

## Conventions

- Use `as const` for literal branding values.
- Organize assets by feature or usage context.
