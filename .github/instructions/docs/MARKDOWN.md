# Markdown Documentation Rules

- Keep headings stable and concise; one H1 per doc.
- Use relative links; validate they resolve.
- Prefer short sections; link to deeper docs rather than duplicating.
- Include “Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD” if the doc is user-facing.
- Use code blocks with language hints; show minimal runnable examples.
