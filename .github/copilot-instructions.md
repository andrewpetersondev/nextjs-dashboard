## I am in development!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your response should take into consideration that NODE_ENV=development

Docker-specific instructions:

Configure Docker Compose to use the --watch flag for continuous monitoring during development.
Ensure that the Next.js and PostgreSQL containers are linked correctly.
Mount the necessary volumes for code and database persistence.

Debugging instructions:

Set up a remote debugging configuration in vscode for your Next.js application running in the Docker container.

Use breakpoints, step-by-step execution, and variable inspections in WebStorm for debugging.

I am using VS Code.

Make sure local code and remote code is syncing.
