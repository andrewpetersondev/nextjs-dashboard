## Next Steps

Where am I?
- containers work pretty well but do the database is not properly initialized when the db container is created
    - the container runs, but schema and seed are run manually. Schema and Seed must be run on container creation.

Today's Work
- when containers are created, properly initialize db with schema and seed
- set up Vitest for Unit TESTING
